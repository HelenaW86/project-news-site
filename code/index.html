        <h2>The first man has landed on the moon</h2>
        <strong>One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind</strong>
        <p>Den 25 juni 1958 blev Armstrong, tillsammans med åtta andra piloter, utvald att delta i amerikanska flottans projekt Man in space Soonest som var ett program för att så snabbt som möjligt skicka upp en människa i rymden. Projektet lades ner 1 oktober 1958 när Nasa bildades och skulle administrera alla USA:s bemannade rymdflygningar. 
        Den 17 september 1962 blev Armstrong som en av nio nya astronauter uttagen i Nasa:s astronautkår, specifikt till astronautgrupp 2.
        Armstrong undgick döden med liten marginal när LLRV, en träningsmaskin som skulle simulera månlandaren, kraschade 6 maj 1968.
        Armstrong lämnade Nasa 1 augusti 1970. 1971-1979 undervisade Armstrong i teknik vid University of Cincinnati. Han tjänstgjorde 1986 i den kommission som undersökte Challengerolyckan.

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
          specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
           the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
           like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <p>The Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem,
          Millennium bug, Y2K bug, Y2K glitch or Y2K error, 
          refers to potential computer errors related to the 
          formatting and storage of calendar data for dates in 
          and after the year 2000. Many programs represented four-digit
          years with only the final two digits, making the year 2000
          indistinguishable from 1900. Computer systems' inability to 
          distinguish dates correctly could potentially bring down 
          worldwide infrastructures for industries ranging from 
          banking to air travel.
